Run Phoronix Cross-Platform Benchmarks
======================================

These are scripts for running cross-platform (OS X and Linux) Phoronix test suites, which are listed in http://goo.gl/4sOHpO, with default options.

Setup the test run:

    ./setup.sh

Run benchmark:

    ./benchmark.sh

When tests are complete, the result (`composite.xml` file) will be opened in your web browser. You'll have to view page source to see it.

You can also read the HTML report on http://openbenchmarking.org, whose URL will be displayed by the benchmark script.
